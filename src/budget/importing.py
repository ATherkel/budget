"""Import one inbox export into Bronze, archive it, and log its import run.

This is the Bronze step `budget import` runs for each file in the inbox. The
file's folder declares its account (`inbox/<account_id>/`), `accounts.toml`
declares the account's source format, and the operator declares what the
export covers. The run is recorded in Bronze, its bytes are archived under
`exports/<account_id>/`, and the run is mirrored in `imports.jsonl`. Only then
does the file leave the inbox.
