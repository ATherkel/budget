"""`gold.build`: Gold records from Silver, the account registry and the taxonomy.

Nothing is classified yet, so every transaction is `unknown`. The expected
records are the worked example's (`gold-layer.md`), and the other cases are
synthetic. Records come in no fixed order, so they are compared as multisets.
